\Abstract
Substation automation systems (SAS) increasingly rely on information and communication technology for monitoring and control.
This leads to new challenges with regard to information security.
Existing standards such as IEC 61850 and IEC 62351 do not sufficiently cover recent developments, including attribute-based access control (ABAC) and attribute-based public key cryptography (AB-PKC).
Therefore, we propose a certificateless attribute-based server-aided cryptosystem for SAS (CASC-SAS).
Our approach consists of two core concepts referred to as CASA and SABAAC.
The certificateless attribute-based server-aided authentication (CASA) provides asymmetric cryptographic protocols and schemes that serve as a foundation for cybersecurity approaches in a SAS.
The server-aided attribute-based authorization and access control (SABAAC) prevents unauthorized access to devices of a SAS based on ABAC policies.
By employing server-aided protocols and speedup techniques, our approach takes the strict time and resource constraints of the SAS domain into account.
To demonstrate our approach, we propose realizing it as a fully functional test bed that mimics the behavior of a real interconnected SAS.
Moreover, we propose a theoretical and experimental evaluation of the security, performance, and economic aspects of our approach.
